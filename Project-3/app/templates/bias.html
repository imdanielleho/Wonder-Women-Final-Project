            <p class="lead font-weight-normal">As discussed in the first half of the analysis, female workforce participation has increased substantially since 1990, and an increase in female workforce participation generates economic growth and positively impacts global GDP. The second half of this analysis explores female workforce participation and representation in the corporate world. More specifically, it explores the ways in which gendered wording in job descriptions pose a barrier to women entering the corporate workforce, perpetuate institutional level gender inequality, and maintain women’s underrepresentation in male dominated industries. Gendered wording refers to masculine and feminine words that are often associated with gender stereotypes. In the second half of this analysis, five male dominated industries, five female dominated industries and 5,000 postings in total were assessed to determine their level of gender bias. Read below the results of this assessment and how gendered wording in a job description can alter job appeal for a woman, and her perceived sense of belonging in that role.

                      LinkedIn research shows that women are 16% less likely to apply to a job after viewing it than men, and language is a significant contributor of that

                    <li>
                      Recent research revealed that 60% of businesses showed significant male bias in the wording of their job adverts and 70% of listings across industries contain masculine words

                    <br>
                    <li>
                      Job ads for male-dominated occupations use greater masculine wording than ads for female-dominated occupations among professionals and college students

                    <li>
                      Job listings with gender-neutral wording get 42% more responses

                    Women are more interested in male-dominated jobs when the job descriptions are unbiased

                  <br>
                  <li>
                    Women find occupations that are masculinely worded less appealing regardless of whether the occupations are traditionally more male or female dominatedy

                  <br>
                  <li>
                    Both men and women find jobs most attractive when there is a match between their gender and the gendered wording used in the advertisement

                  <br>
                  <li>
                    The mere presence of masculine words such as challenge, lead, boast, and active in advertisements made jobs appear less gender diverse and less appealing to women, even though these words composed a fraction of the total words in the advertisements
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>

                      Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that male dominated industries utilize more masculine gendered words in their job descriptions, while female dominated industries utilize more feminine gendered words 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      Although masculine gendered words predominate in male dominated industries and female gendered words predominate in female dominated industries, masculine gendered words are more prevalent across the board (i.e. there are more masculine gendered words present in female dominated industries than there are feminine gendered words in male dominated industries)
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      Studies have shown that companies with diverse workforce perform better and produce more innovative outcomes
                    </li>
