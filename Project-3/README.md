# Wonder Women Editor
## Final Project


We began our research by exploring the link between an increase in female work force participation and GDP growth. Through our research, we found that globally, female workforce participation has seen a 6.2% growth since 1990 and an increase in female workforce participation generates economic growth.

One way to increase female participation in the workforce is by eliminating the use of gender biased wording in job descriptions, which, research from the American Psychological Association has proven that this is one of the leading barriers that prevent women from entering the workforce. Our tool, the **Wonder Women Editor**, allows recruiters and hiring managers get their job descriptions to a place of gender neutrality and ultimately get more female candidates in the pipeline.

We scraped 5000 job descriptions from 5 male dominated industries, 5 female dominated from LinkedIn and found that 6 out of 10 industries had job descriptions that were dominated by masculine language. Studies have shown that women find job ads that are masculine-worded less appealing, and that job listings with gender-neutral wording get 42% more responses.

To use our tool, insert your job description in the text box. Then, your job description will be given a score that indicates its level of gender bias. On the right hand panel, you can see a count of masculine and feminine gendered words, as well as gender pronouns and superlatives your job description possesses. Hover over each highlighted word to get suggestions on a gender neutral replacement words and get a better scoring. When your job description is rid of bias, save it and share it on job listing sites to attract gender diverse talent!

We know that companies with diverse workforce perform better and produce more innovative outcomes, so use our tool to draw in a more diverse pool of candidates and ultimately improve the productivity of your company!
